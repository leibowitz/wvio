What Version Is On

Use this project at wvio.dev/php-statement-service 
to get information about the version of statement 
service deployed on your environment.

Change the file config/environment.txt with any 
environment you like, for example staging,
and create a settings.yml file in 
config/staging/settings.yml with your
projects urls

Make sure you set the token in the config 
to your own github token (you will need 
to create one via github > Settings > Applications
Personal Access Tokens)
